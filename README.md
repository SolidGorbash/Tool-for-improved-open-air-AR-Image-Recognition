# Tool-for-improved-open-air-AR-Image-Recognition
Tool designed to automate and improve open air image recognition using Unity 3D and AR Foundation.

The Unity Package includes both the main CropTool.cs Script and the Unity Editor scene with an empty gameobject to kickstart the use of the software.

The Unity Editor import settings for texture have to be modified, allowing read and write and is usefull to disable any type of downscaling algorithm aswell to allow a more precise division.

At this state the software needs division factors that will divide the image evenly withour remainder. A new version of the software is being worked on to allow to choose a proper division factor.
